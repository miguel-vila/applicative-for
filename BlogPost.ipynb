    "# Towards an Applicative for macro\n",
    "\n",
    "(This post is Jupyter notebook you can download and run. You can download it [here]())\n",
    "\n",
    "Some time ago with the release of the Haskell's [Haxl](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haxl) library the same authors realized that the `do` notation in Haskell could use some improvements. The `do` notation can be used to \"flatten\" deep nestings of `>>=` applications. For example instead of writting something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "findVal :: String -> Maybe Int\n",
    "findVal key = ... -- some function definition\n",
    "\n",
    "sum :: Maybe Int\n",
    "sum = (findVal \"key1\") >>= (\\val1 -> (findVal \"key2\") >>= (\\val2 -> return (val1 + val2))))\n",
    "```\n",
    "you can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "sum :: Maybe Int\n",
    "sum = do val1 <- findVal \"key1\"\n",
    "         val2 <- findVal \"key2\"\n",
    "         return (val1 + val2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it easier to read the expression and to understand what's going on. Haskell's compiler simply desugars this notation to `>>=` applications. The `do` notation is specially readable because you can interpret it as follows: At the left side of a `<-` you will find the \"extracted\" value of the monadic value at the right side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now as you may have noticed in the previous example we are not using the whole power of the `Monad` typeclass. We are just calling `>>=` because we want to have the values inside the monadic values in the same place so we can express our desired computation: `(val1 + val2)`. But `Monad` is more powerful than that! For example we can express something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "do val1 <- findVal \"key1\"\n",
    "   val2 <- findVal (\"key\" ++ show val1)\n",
    "   return val2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the second monadic value depends on the result of the first monadic value. Unlike the previous example this can only be achieved with something as powerful as `Monad`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When programming we want to use the least powerful abstraction and in functional programming this translates into using the least specific typeclass. In this case the least powerful abstraction that allows us to join values in different contexts into one is `Applicative`. We can rewrite the first example like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "add x y = x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "sum = add <$> (findVal \"key1\") <*> (findVal \"key2\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are thinking this is less readable than the `do` version you are on to something. As it turns out for the `Maybe` monad there is not much difference between choosing one style over the other because both alternatives have a similar performance. But there are other monads in which it is preferrable to use `Applicative` when possible. The first one that comes to my mind is precisely Haxl's `Fetch` monad. With `Fetch` applicative independent computations can be done concurrently. Even more if they access the same data source then the query can be batched.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance in the following situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "fetchData :: String -> Fetch Data\n",
    "fetchData key = ... -- build fetch value\n",
    "\n",
    "join x y = (x,y)\n",
    "\n",
    "dataTuple :: (Data,Data)\n",
    "dataTuple = join <$> fetchData \"key1\" <*> fetchData \"key2\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The same final result can be expressed with `do`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "do data1 <- fetchData \"key1\"\n",
    "   data2 <- fetchData \"key2\"\n",
    "   return (data1,data2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is a catch: given that in this situation the `do` expression is desugared into `>>=` applications then the fetches are done sequentially. This is because the first monadic value must be computed before computing the one in the second line. Thus, by trying to use a more intuitive and readable notation we are incurring in a performance loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "But the problem is not just readability. When you are making changes to a codebase you must be aware that the change may allow you to use `Applicative` instead of monad. This may happen if, for example you are changing a line of a `do` expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wouldn't it be cool if `do` expressions would use `Monad` just when they are strictly necessary and `Applicative` where possible? This would allow us to always use the `do` notation without having to worry if we are using the correct typeclass. This is precisely the topic of Haxl's follow-up [paper](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/list-comp/applicativedo.pdf). There is a [proposal](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/ApplicativeDo) in the Haskell community to include this behaviour in the GHC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's see in Scala how useful this could be. First remember that Scala's `for` comprehensions are similar to Haskell's `do` expressions: they just call `flatMap` for each `<-` except for the last one which will be a `map` call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with our very own definition of a `Validation` which will be similar to Scalaz's `ValidationNel` or Cat's `ValidatedNel`:"
